# Intro

I am a research assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am developing novel regenerative therapies to replenish the lost cardiac tissue after myocardium infarction.

In my spare time, I invest time in developing new skills that allow me to approach my ideas with different perspective. I also enjoy anything with logical deductions, such as detective novels and puzzle solving video games.
