In this study, together with my colleagues, I uncovered a novel role for CARM1, a histone H3R17 methyltransferase, in postnatal cardiomyocyte maturation. By performing ChIP-seq on postnatal hearts with Carm1 knockout, I demonstrated that CARM1 cooperates with cardiac transcription factors, particularly GATA4, to activate and maintain the cardiac muscle maturation program through H3R17me2a deposition. The GWAS analysis revealed a significant overlap between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cardiomyopathy, QT interval, and arrhythmia, and promoter and enhancer regions marked by H3R17me2a."}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{children:"This study highlights the critical role of arginine methylation in regulating cardiomyocyte maturation and heart development.
