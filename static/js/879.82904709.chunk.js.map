This Ascl1-Mef2c combination not only\n        outperforms conventional reprogramming cocktails in terms of efficiency but is also\n        compact enough to be delivered via a single AAV virus particle for in vivo applications.\n        This makes Ascl1 + Mef2c highly promising for replenishing cardiomyocytes after heart\n        injury through direct delivery.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Conceptually, the cross-lineage potential of Ascl1 challenges the foundational principle\n        of cellular reprogramming, which relies on using strictly lineage-specific factors to\n        generate corresponding cell types. The discovery of more cross-lineage TFs like Ascl1\n        may prompt a reevaluation of the relationship between direct reprogramming and\n        developmental biology. This could open new possibilities for regenerative medicine and\n        lead to more efficient reprogramming strategies for various cell types.\n      </p>\n    </article>\n  </Main>\n);\n\nexport default Project1;\n"],"names":["Project1","_jsx","Main","title","description","children","_jsxs","className","id","Link","to","style","textAlign","src","alt","width","height"],"sourceRoot":""}
